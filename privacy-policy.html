    <h1>Privacy Policy for Legato Pages</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [18/07/2025]</p>
    <p>Thank you for using Legato Pages ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in relation to the App.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: <a href="mailto:[flux.zenapp@gmail.com]">[flux.zenapp@gmail.com]</a></p>
    
    <h2>1. Information We Handle</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a functional peer-to-peer PDF sharing experience without collecting your personal data. The information handled by the App falls into two categories:</p>
    
    <h3>A. Information You Provide</h3>
    <p><strong>PDF Files:</strong> The App requires access to PDF files that you explicitly select through the system's file picker. These files are processed on your device to be rendered and shared with other devices you connect to. These files are never uploaded to our servers.</p>
    
    <h3>B. Information Collected Automatically for Stability</h3>
    <p><strong>Firebase Crashlytics:</strong> To improve the stability and performance of our App, we use Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google. When the App crashes, Crashlytics automatically collects certain non-personally identifiable information, which may include device type, operating system version, and a unique identifier related to the crash instance. This information is used solely for the purpose of diagnosing and fixing bugs.</p>
    
    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To Provide Core Functionality:</strong> The App uses the Google Nearby Connections API to discover, connect, and transfer files between your nearby devices. This communication is peer-to-peer and is managed by Google Play Services.</li>
        <li><strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We use the aggregated, anonymous data from Firebase Crashlytics to identify and resolve crashes.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Caching:</strong> To improve performance, the App caches PDF files you have opened in a private, local directory on your device. This data remains on your device.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information. Data is shared only with Google for the purpose of providing the Nearby Connections API and Firebase Crashlytics services, as governed by Google's own Privacy Policy.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
